                        <p>
                            Our client recently approached us with the need for a web application that could handle multiple services, each requiring a unique application form and document upload process. These services had to go through a custom workflow system involving various roles, each with specific actions. The challenge was that each service had its own requirements, and the process needed to adhere to a strict timeline. If any step was delayed, the system should trigger an alert. The project was given an extremely tight deadline, with a budget initially designed for a single service application.

                            Given the unclear data and document requirements for the services, and the fact that the workflow was documented, we decided to take a unique approach. Rather than building separate applications for each service, we developed a single web application capable of managing multiple services. This solution was not only flexible but also scalable, allowing the addition of more services in the future.

                            We created a form generator that could dynamically create forms with varying field types, data types, and document upload options, tailored to each service's needs. To manage the workflow, we introduced a new concept called the 'Service Matrix.' This data structure defined the responsibilities, actions, and timelines for each stage in the workflow. By using this matrix, we could control who does what, when, and within what timeframe for each service. We also designed a single multipurpose screen for managing all actions—except the one action that differed at each level within the Service Matrix. The entire program was developed with simplicity, flexibility, and scalability in mind.
