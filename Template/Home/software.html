                <h2>Custom Web Development</h2>
                <p>Background: 
                    The Deonar dumping ground (DDG) has been facing several incidents of fire and other rampages in the recent past. The management has brought in better security and firefighting arrangements into the site by installing surveillance booths, skilled security and firefighting personnel and latest equipment to aid in the surveillance and firefighting activities. The details of the equipment, personnel and the daily surveillance activity report, incidents are currently maintained in registers. The maintenance and distribution of the data is cumbersome and requires a lot of physical and manual interventions.
                    <br>
                    Need for the new system:
                    The new system has to maintain the data and document in a digital form and make it easily accessible for the stakeholders.<br>
                    Features:
                    A standalone application at the DDG to maintain the staff and equipment records, daily surveillance plans and records, fire drill plans and records and the SOPs.
                    A web based application to make available daily, periodic reports, SOP and other documents view, SOP maintenance and management with version control, Incidence management and dashboards of activities to the various stakeholders of the DDG management.
